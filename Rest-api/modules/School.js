Currently, it is located at Abad Santos Street, Barangay Santo Nino, Gapan City with the hope that the college-owned campus will be built on its lot along Maharlika Highway, Bayanihan, Gapan City in the near future. After three years Guimba Campus was built, located at Parairo St., Saranay Dist., Guimba, Nueva Ecija and followed by San Jose Campus located at Sanchez St., San Jose City.
